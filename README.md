Project Overview: Basic Java Calculator
1. Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly calculator in Java. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project serves as a foundational introduction to Java programming, utilizing essential concepts like user input, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations.

2. Key Features:
User Input: The program prompts the user to input two numbers and choose an operation.
Operation Selection: The user can choose from four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: The program includes basic error handling for invalid operation choices and division by zero.
Result Display: After the operation is performed, the result is displayed to the user.

3. Core Java Concepts Used:
Scanner Class: Used to take input from the user for the numbers and the operation choice.
Switch-Case Statement: Handles the different operations based on the user's input (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Conditionals: Error handling for cases like division by zero and invalid operation selection.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Implements fundamental math operations using Java operators.

4. Execution Flow:
The user is first prompted to enter two numbers.
The program then presents four arithmetic operations and prompts the user to choose one by entering a corresponding number.
Based on the user's selection, the appropriate calculation is performed, and the result is displayed.
If the user attempts to divide by zero or selects an invalid operation, the program displays an appropriate error message.

5. Use Case:
Educational Tool: This calculator program is ideal for beginners learning Java programming. It demonstrates basic program flow, user input handling, and decision-making processes in Java.
Real-World Application: Although simple, the core structure can be expanded into more complex calculators or integrated into larger applications that require mathematical calculations.

6. Conclusion:
This project provides a foundational understanding of how Java can be used to interact with users, process inputs, and perform basic mathematical operations. By building this program, learners can practice essential Java programming skills and logic.
